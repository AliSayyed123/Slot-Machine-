This is a simple terminal-based Slot Machine game written in Python. The player can deposit money, place bets on up to 3 lines, and spin to try their luck. The game rewards the player based on matched symbols across the selected lines.

## ðŸ§  Game Rules

- You can bet on **1 to 3 horizontal lines** (top, middle, bottom).
- You place a **bet per line** (between `$1` and `$100`).
- The slot machine has a **3x3 grid** of symbols (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) chosen based on weighted frequencies.
- You **win** if all three symbols in a selected line match.
- Each symbol has a different payout value:

| Symbol | Frequency | Value |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| A      | 2         | 5x    |
| B      | 4         | 4x    |
| C      | 6         | 3x    |
| D      | 8         | 2x    |
